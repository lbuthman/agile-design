- Ingredients for testing / survey scripts
  1) Introduction
  2) Reassurance (testing the app, not them)
  3) Testing Guidelines
  4) Tasks (quantifiable, but I would add qualitative topics as well)
  5) Conclusion (can be fun to share what we have learned with them)
  6) Thanks!
  
- Encourage participants to think out loud, instead of internally focusing on the task. It may feel silly, but it
is important. ("Imagine that your experience and task is the most important thing in the entire world, to you and
everyone else in it! Because of that, the entire world is hanging on each word and paying attentio to your every
utterance and experience. They will be so sad if they miss even a single thing.

- Be careful of turning usability studies into training sessions. The user needs to do the task themselves so that
we can get an honest assessment.

- Short questionaires are good ways to transition between tasks, providing time for us to take notes without making
them sit in silence and get distracted or restless.
