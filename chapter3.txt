- Sometimes users can feel defensive or inadequate when working with a developer. It can help to admit that you
don't have all the answers and in fact need their help. They are the experts and we are trying to design systems
that make sense to them.

- Information Overloader -> coach them in how to focus on what is helpful, provide consistent status updates, and
realize they are actually good problems

- Control Freak -> provide options that will focus their input and minimize their control, involve them early and 
respect the meeting by moving on when necessary, can be great advocates and potential super users

- Devil's Advocate -> diversify and name other roles to balance this persona, giving each person a hat to wear so
that through role play the perspective becomes even and equally represented

- Negativity -> admit that negativity reduces moral and motivation, while you can learn from mistakes, you can also
learn from success
