- Everything is best for something and worst for something else

- A persona is a character that helps you remember who you're app is for.
  -- What are your favorite products? Why are they better than similar products?
  -- What product frustrates you the most? Why? How would you improve it?
  -- Fill it out with details like Name, Age, Marital/Family Status, Location, Occupation, Hobbies/Favorites,
  Needs/Frustrations
  
- Once you have a persona to embody application users, you can create scenarios: mini-stories the persona will
find themselves in. This then is a jumping off point for what they would do, want, etc.
