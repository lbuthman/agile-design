- Answer the following fundamental questions
  -- What problem does your application solve? What's its core focus?
  -- Who are the ideal users for your application? What are they like? Are they advanced users or novices?
  -- What are your three must-have features? How do you know they are the most important?
  -- How will your application provide value? How will it improve on what people are currently using?

- It has been stated that 5 different kinds of users is an ideal number for providing feedback about the app.

- In a survey, how the questions are asked and the choices are presented can result in confirmation bias. I like
the example asking how often a messaging feature is used. It is neutral and practical.
  -- How would I answer a question? How would my mom answer that question?
  
- Contextual inquires -> use the product / do research in the solutions domain (a fitness app in a gym, a mobile on the
move, etc)

- When creating prototypes, lower fidelity may be better when working with customers/users/business owners. If the
prototype is too polished, they may think that it is close to being done and not question embedded functionality as much.
If less developed, the prototype projects an image of less commitment and can embolden a partner to dig deeper in their
feedback.

- Taking A/B testing to every feature and facet pushing every decision into the hands of the data. While it is great in 
many ways, it can't be used for everything. The comparison to Ground Hog Day is great; he slowly puts together the perfect
date and it still doesn't work!
