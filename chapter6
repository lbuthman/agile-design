- Beyond collecting requirements and user-acceptance tests, consider the user's experience while completing the task/goal.
  -- How important is load time? Willing to wait if experience is rich?
  -- How does user interact with system? How does input impact information presentation?
  -- Should it be fun? Amusement and surprise or consistency?
  -- What's the tone? Whimsical, professional, supportive, energetic?
  -- Is the language consistent?
  
- Creativity involves personal resolve and grit, even courage.

- Draw, sketch, write: get to ideas early and concretely.

- Having a vision and goal can beat back detractors and naysayers.

- Keep a virtual drawer of interesting, cool, etc. ideas -> login pages, tech implementations, etc.
  -> Dribble can be a good source for inspiration.
  -> Browsing sites like Dribble and Pinterest will have little impact if you're not taking the time to reflect on what
  you have found.
    -- Why is this product/service a success or failure?
    -- What's the website doing its competitors aren't? Is there a better approach?
    -- What about the app design, do I like/dislike it?
    -- Why does this product frustrate me? How would I like it better?
