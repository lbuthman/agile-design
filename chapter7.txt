- Proximity principal -> Items grouped together seem to have stronger relationships than items further apart; good
for logical organization

- Visibility -> bring visual focus (typeface, opacity, prominence, status, color/contrast)

- Visual Hierarchy -> try affinity diagramming with post-it notes to physically identify like groups and logical
organization used for visual layout

- Mental Models -> be aware (and don't assume) the user's mental model, that will impact the user's expectations
with the system

- Progressive discoler -> hiding options and functionality in menus so as not to overwhelm users. Items can be greyed
out when not applicable, thus reducing noise.

- Implement common functionality in accordance to what a user expects, only change if it is self-evidently better

- Affordance and constraints -> "Make it easy to do the right thing and difficult to do the wrong thing."

- Anticipate undesired actions with confirmation requirements. What strikes me about this is the misuse by web
designers hoping to increase subscription. They require confirmation about what they want, not what the user (reader)
wants. This clarifies my problems with these sites.

- Fitt's Law -> The distance users have to travel from an object should dictate the size of the object they are moving to.
